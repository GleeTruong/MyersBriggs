She said I was petty for it.DEAD  &lt;Laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses&gt;     perfect. I don't like dealing with middle men either. You can talk directly to me.  ;)I can sell you the dreamLOL DEAD. Ha!The point is that when you are making a point of thinking critically but not thinking beyond common sense, you aren't using your brain. A little bit of effort now to have an understanding of theThat's just common sense  No, that's just a value judgement backed by popular opinion from social stupidity/laziness. That's only doing what works instead of pushing harder and doing what isWhen it comes to children, they either cry or climb all over me. There is never a gray area.I don't drink, but when I drank:  Beer: Hardcore ciders and sweet brown ales.

I stay on course,Your answer was worth more time to entertain than the OP.Hey @MsBossyPants are you down for a debate on Ayn Rand vs Marx? Maybe we should talk about our poor Fi? Oh I know- let's try to correlate testing ENTJ with being sociopathic.   &lt;laughing&gt; Hitler was no exception- this concept has, is and always will be a principle, tenet, and rule. Politics, ideology, religion, eating, shitting usual.  And if it's not ,then there is nothing toHitler thought he was doing great things. Stalin thought he was justified. These guys thought they were uncorrupt. They viewed any heretic to their dogmas as morally bankrupt, and so did many ofMeh. There were plenty of evil people who did good things, and plenty of good people who got blood on their hands achieving and attaining higher goals. Bad situations that had good long term effects,You would have to ask the OP. He is asking ambiguous questions. I would go with whatever is more efficient/effective vs what is perceived as good every time in the good vs evil dichotomy. It in myGood vs Bad  &lt;Skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant&gt; = Good vs Evil One is an objective positive vs negative dichotomy, the other is a subjective interpretation of characteristics.

Did they expose themselves on the internet? Yes. Does this warrant or validate a reasonI really REEEEEEAAALLLY hate rigidly PC thumb sucking nanny bitches. They remind me of five year olds who are trying too hard to gain their parents approval by taddling. These are the same people,I think people need to get some skin. Even if these people are wrong or racist. That's just a waste of time, energy, and resources. These people end up being the focus for being petty and overboard not trying to be condescending when I tell you- all those things you have mentioned people saying and have written off as all I have been met with are legit arguments. They don't need to beThe brevity of my posts is because you don't take much to refute. Just because you aren't acknowledging what people are saying doesn't mean they are saying nothing.'</td>\n",

If you need a literal analysis, I'm happy to provide it. That said, I'm going to assume you're able to read and interpret symbolism, so I doubt you'll need that much help.|||And this was sort of my thought process.

All other types hurt in deep existential ways that I want no part of.Probably a sliding scale that depends on individual preferences, like everything in humanity.Draco Malfoy also. I'd say he's either  or .I'm either  or , though in which stacking to me is a somewhat arbitrary distinction to make as I believe that the core indicates primary motivation and has a hand in every action. Therefore, aI'm not particularly introverted or extraverted, personally. That said, I would say I'm somewhat unphased by either social interactions or being alone. What I'd say I crave more so than anything isDear Type  INFP,  Your absolute admiration of me is refreshing. You're a great girlfriend and I wish we both didn't have such busy schedules so we could be around one another more often.  Keep% still means about / people. I've probably seen - others today. I never understood fascination by virtue of rarity.So, you're on the ESFJ train also, right?I have toyed with the idea of the OP being an extrovert also for awhile now, actually.

If I were you, I'd definitely talk to her about it.Yeah, I had a lot longer to think about it. That said, I don't think you're Te, so if we operate under the assumptions in the OP, you're INFJ because nothing else makes sense. I'm not saying IWhether or not you actually are, your mom makes fun of you for being a virgin? Is this playful teasing?Just stab in the dark here, I don't think that's Te under the hood. If this here is all I'm given to work with, I'd have to say INFJ.  Compare your idea of 'logic' to mine:  Logic is a series ofWhat makes the most sense?Tentatively INTJ. Still reading.

As far as I can tell, I dislike all J types in my normal life.I'm not of the mind that any enneatype/MBTI combination is impossible because cognition  <Skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant> = the things that motivate us. That said, we can clearly observe many types being more common than othersSx as hell    seriously toying with the idea of being . I can be pretty aggressive and controlling, but I have a massive 'holier than thou' streak once you get to know me with any depth (like more than -I'd say it's a mostly emotional experience.Because I find in depth study of cognition more interesting.

If you need a literal analysis, I'm happy to provide it. That said, I'm going to assume you're able to read and interpret symbolism, so I doubt you'll need that much help.And this was sort of my thought process. The initial post and how it connects the generally accepted view of the type  and what the type  is motivated by doesn't seem to be in need of explanation.Oh my  I am quite crushable, huh?

Asked me to say goodnight to her.  Asked me to say goodnight to her again.  I did. I thought it was weird, secretly.  I likeEither way, you see my point. The actual rarity is skewed and makes a type seem rarer than it likely is in real contexts. I may have been the only one of my type in a class room in High School, butWOW my math was off! I literally just said numbers. See how over glorified the type is?  Even so, though. I saw around two-hundred people (REALLY rough estimate) between both of my jobs. It'sRarity in the context of the entire planet is somewhat silly. Even if we assume the greatest reports of our 'rarity', we (INTJ) encompass % of the planet, which sounds rare when you don't thinkOne could say that whatever the culmination of all of our actions are throughout our lives equal our potential.  In this sense, everybody does, but as we all know, not everyone's potential is theI would agree, however, those that profess to know their type not stating anything about their type's motivations strike me as either not wanting to touch on them or not being able to.

I make websites so know how sometimes you need them. Just a reccomendation though, make them open in a new window when clicked ('target=_top')Yes I want people to Understand. Some people anyway. But I think it doesn't matter if they could understand me, because so many people don't care to. Not really and fully.Just interested to know what some other INFJs' ideas are on letting people in to our lives, or keeping a distance. Personaly there are very few people I let in to my world at all, and I let no oneI wouldn't be bothered personally. Actually I sometimes actually think that I don't realize how obvious I can be or how others might feel.If I don't see good in someone, I won't hang around. If it happens to be you chances are you won't notice me by accident. I can be good at just disappearing If I don't want to see youIn a library or out on a walk somewhere remote aloneI agree, and although i'm a very black and white person (on the outside anyway), this website needs some colour. It is too bright and the black doesn't help at all.I'm defiantly a night person, no doubt about it. I enjoy being out late and sleeping half the day away.When you say you have lost your balance I knew exactly how you feel, I can say I'm in a similar place right now and have lost the thing that really keeps me going (my balance) and my world i spinningLooks good! I think the top navigation bar/news would look better with a darker colour, white seems to bright.I Would Be With The Tenth, all the way.   Actually Both of them ;) - and Capt. JackI was going to say that (About Doctor Who), but I thought my second thing seemed more appropriate.     But apart from the TARDIS, I would get in my car and just drive, stopping only to enjoy aThanks @Solitude. Your right and I do like constructive criticism because you have something to work on and improve, i guess it just upset me a little.How do you feel when people criticize your work or something you do?  Whenever someone tells me that something I have done is not good enough it makes me feel like I am not good enough.   MaybeYES -  Owner of a Lonely Heart   a Doctor Who fan I have to say Repeated memory wipes by the Silence will eventually fry your brain - The Eleventh Doctor But I'm the same, and when I do remember it's after a while and peopleCurrently I am reading 'The White Wolf's Son', a good read. Not quite what I expected when I picked it up but I will finish it soon. and next I want to read 'The Wolf Gift'Tonight I sit outside my window in the blackness of night, staring out into the wilderness we call space. Peace. Beauty. I could stay here till the morning light. The thousands of suns I stare uponI was going to close my facebook a few months back, but as well as wanting to be able to message my family in ausse and school friends i found that i had connected a few other websites to it Seconds to Mars - All of my collections. It seems to be fitting my mood right now.I have seen it, and i agree. I did actually think that the first time I watched the movie, and from the beginning (or when they got their powers) I kinda thought Andrew would never work right withOk so i have just watched Underworld  (Awakening) and must say it was a really good film, Compared to the other films out in the last few months anyway. I don't think it was as good as the first I would never want to turn off my emotions. sometimes I hide them from the world, but I still need them for me.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
